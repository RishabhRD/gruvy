Gruvy
===

Grubuddy(credits to: TJ Devries) without colorbuddy.

I like gruvbuddy colorscheme a lot. However, it depends on colorbuddy.
The only problem is I like to switch colorschemes sometimes or sometimes I want
transparency. However, I always face problems with these 2 actions with
grubuddy or any other colorbuddy based colorschemes.

So, I used Lush to almost get the grubuddy colors.

Gruvy is based on gruvbuddy colors. I did some minor tweaks to colors to suite
my needs (like colorcolumn and tabs). And that's it.
